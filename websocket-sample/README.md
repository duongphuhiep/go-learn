# Websocket and Server Sent Event "Hello World"

## Websocket

WebSocket provides full-duplex, bidirectional communication over a single, persistent connection. It is ideal for scenarios where low latency and high-frequency communication are required.

## Server-Sent Events (SSE)

SSE is a server-to-client, unidirectional communication protocol. It allows the server to push updates to the client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection.

### Use Cases

- **Real-Time Notifications:**
  - Social media updates (e.g., new likes, comments).
  - Email or message notifications.
- **Live Feeds:**
  - News tickers.
  - Live score updates.
  - Social media feeds (e.g., Twitter timeline).
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Real-time system monitoring (e.g., CPU usage, logs).
  - Progress updates for long-running tasks (e.g., file uploads, data processing).
- **Stock Market Data:**
  - Streaming stock prices or financial data.

### Advantages

- Simple to implement (uses standard HTTP/HTTPS).
- Built-in reconnection and event ID mechanisms.
- Efficient for server-to-client updates.

### Disadvantages

- Unidirectional (server to client only).
- Not supported in older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer).
- Less efficient for high-frequency updates compared to WebSocket.
